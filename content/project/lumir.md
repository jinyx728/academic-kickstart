Lumir is the course project of SE342-Computer-Vision. It is written in C++, using Qt framework.

Lumir provides various image processing algorithms. **All of the algorithms are written by myself**, without using libraries like OpenCV. Supported algorithms are listed below:

* RGB channel seperation
* RGB to GRAY
* Hue/Saturation/Value adjustment
* Binarization (Otsu algorithm or double threshold)
* Rotation/Scaling (nearest neighbor interpolation or bilinear interpolation)
* Image add/minus/multiply operation
* Clipping
* Contrast adjustment (piecewise linear, exponent, logarithm or histogram equalization)
* Smoothing filter (mean filter, gaussian filter or median filter)
* Edge detection (Sobel operator, Laplace operator or Canny operator)
* Hough transform (detect line or circle)
* Binary morphology (dilation, erosion, open, close, thinning, thickening)
* Distance transform
* Skeleton extraction and reconstruction
* Grayscale morphology (dilation, erosion, open, close)
* Watershed algorithm
