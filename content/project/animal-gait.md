I did this research project at [State Key Lab of CAD/CG](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/english.html), [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), advised by [Weiwei Xu](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/weiweixu/weiweixu_en.htm).

I developed a system that could automatically generate gait and form given an animal skeleton. I referred the method proposed in [*Optimal Gait and Form for Animal Locomotion*](http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/animal-morphology/s2009/). Given the mass of different parts of the animal, I used a objective function as a inner loop and a sample based optimization method as a outer loop. The inner loop penalized joint torque, joint velocity and head motion. I used SQP optimization method to solve this constrained non-linear optimization problem. The outer loop optimized foot contact time. I used basin-CMA to solve this sample based optimization problem.

All the codes are written in C++. I used rigidbody simulation library, SQP library to implement this system. This system is still under developing. I plan to first use automatic differentiation techniques to compute derivatives, then compute derivatives manually.

**Skills involved: C++, Rigidbody Simulation, SQP, Automatic Differentiation**
